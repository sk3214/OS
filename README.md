# OS
## Pintos Project
<p>This repo contains skeleton code for undergraduate Operating System course honor track at Peking University.

Pintos is a teaching operating system for 32-bit x86, challenging but not overwhelming, small but realistic enough to understand OS 
in depth (it can run on x86 machine and simulators including QEMU, Bochs and VMWare Player!). 
The main source code, documentation and assignments are developed by Ben Pfaff and others from Stanford (refer to its LICENSE).</p>
